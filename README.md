i256 information extraction assignment

Explore the Maluuba API (assuming they are giving out keys). Determine how well it works on a collection. Compute precision and recall on a set of entity types. Label those entities in advance or use a pre-selected collection that already has labels. Be sure to label several hundred, or preferably thousand, of entries.


To turn in:

(i) A text description of what you did, including which suggestion(s) above you did and the motivation behind the code and what was done by each project partner. (5 points)

(ii) The evaluation results (number of items tested, precision and recall or accuracy, as appropriate)(2 points)

(iii) The code itself, commented (8 points)
